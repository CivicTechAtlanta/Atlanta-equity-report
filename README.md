# Atlanta-equity-report
Snapshot of who makes up Atlanta

Maybe it's not as much an "equity" report first as much as it's a demographic snapshot to understand who Atlanta is. But, by understanding who is in Atlanta, it sets us up to better deliver on our goals of being equitable.

The desired outcome is that by collecting various data sources combined with a compelling narrative, we can paint a picture of who makes up Atlanta. This will be a useful reference for future projects to see who we should be including while we are building.

## V1 Requirements
* Identified a reputable source for information, such as [US Census|https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/atlantacitygeorgia/PST045222]
* Gathered data on the following categories
  * Population
  * Race
  * Gender
  * Age
  * Income
  * Top 5 written languages
* Create a simple visualization that's hosted on Github pages
 
## Scope
To avoid burning out by trying to boil the ocean, stay within the following parameters:
* The city limits of Atlanta
  * Don't worry about "the Greater Metro Area" for now
* Choose one year that is relatively easy to get accurate data
  * This helps if data needs to come from multiple sources - everything will be in reference to one period of time
* Prioritize the data sets mentioned above; if all of that is complete, additional data sets to consider (but are not required) are:
  * Internet access
  * Unhoused populations
  * LGBTQ+ populations
